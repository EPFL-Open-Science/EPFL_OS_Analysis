In light of the ongoing pandemic, we feel it is of high value and importance for researchers that just entered the field to have informal discussions with each other and the more senior scientists. In addition to the latest state-of-the-art results and advancements in the field of MRS and MRSI this workshop will cover the latest frontiers in clinical applications and will allow in deep discussions on MRS community achievements during the last 10 &ndash; 15 years. The workshop will feature invited scientific presentations, proffered papers, poster sessions and discussion to work towards guidance on best practices in MRS methodology.<\/p>\n\n<p>SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZING COMMITTEE<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Cristina Cudalbu, Ph.D.<\/strong>,&nbsp;<em>(chair), CIBM MRI EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland&nbsp;<\/em><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>Jannie P.

This includes the following changes:<\/p>\n\n<p>### Upgrade to MuseScore 3<\/p>\n\n<p>* All scores have been converted to [MuseScore](https:\/\/musescore.org\/download) 3.6.2 format and can be found in the folder `MS3`.<br>\n* The harmony labels have been moved to MuseScore&#39;s &quot;Roman Numeral Analysis&quot; layer of the left-hand staff.<\/p>\n\n<p>### New folder and file structure<\/p>\n\n<p>* The `code` folder was removed since the old Julia code has been replaced by the Python library [ms3](https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/ms3\/).<br>\n* The MuseScore files are contained in `MS3` and for each movement there are a couple of other files available, identified by their file names:<br>\n&nbsp; * The folder `notes` contains one TSV file per movement with all note heads (not every note head represents an onset).<br>\n&nbsp; * The folder `measures` contains one TSV file per movement with all measure-like units<br>\n&nbsp; * The folder `harmonies` contains one TSV file per movement with all harmony annotation labels<br>\n&nbsp; * The folder `reviewed` contains two files per movement:<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A copy of the score where all out-of-label notes have been colored in red; additionally, modified labels ( w.r.t. v1.0) are shown in these files in a diff-like manner (removed in red, added in green).<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A copy of the harmonies TSV with six added columns that reflect the coloring of out-of-label notes (&quot;coloring reports&quot;)<br>\n&nbsp; * The file `warnings.log` lists those labels where over 60 % of notes within the label&#39;s segment are not expressed<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the label. Potentially, most of them are semantically incorrect.<\/p>\n\n<p>The folders are automatically kept up to date by the [dcml_corpus_workflow](https:\/\/github.com\/DCMLab\/dcml_corpus_workflow)<br>\nwhich calls the command `ms3 review -M -N -X -D` on every change.<\/p>\n\n<p>Information on what the columns in the TSV files contain can be found in the [documentation for ms3](https:\/\/johentsch.github.io\/ms3\/columns).<\/p>\n\n<p>### Changes to the data<\/p>\n\n<p>**A full diff of all changes applied with version 2.0 can be seen [here](https:\/\/github.com\/DCMLab\/ABC\/commit\/8bd699a9b5b00dba3214c6626575f8368279b965).**<\/p>\n\n<p>* The scores have been aligned by [tunescribers.com](https:\/\/tunescribers.com\/) with the Henle and Breitkopf editions<br>\n&nbsp; provided in the `pdf` folder and indicated in its README.<br>\n* Systematic changes to the harmony labels:<br>\n&nbsp; * With the harmony labels moved to the Roman Numeral Analysis layer, no initial `.` are needed anymore.<br>\n&nbsp; * `V9` is not part of the DCML harmony annotation standard and has been replaced by `V7(9)` or `V7(+9)`.<br>\n&nbsp; * Corrected `vii` chords in major keys that had often been wrongly labeled as `#vii`.<br>\n* Obvious errors have been corrected in many places.

Four research groups formed the leading house on the topic, named DUAL-T, where T stands for technologies and DUAL refers to the Swiss VET system, relying to a great extent upon the alternating of days at school and days in the workplace. This uniquely long-term research scheme has gathered more than 50 research scientists, produced 13 doctoral theses, led to the development of multiple digital learning environments and enabled dozens of empirical studies on thousands of apprentices and hundreds of teachers and company trainers. DUAL-T developed a network of stakeholders, including vocational schools and companies, but also many professional organizations and cantonal or national public entities.

Carbon deposition and external mineralcarrying water should be avoided to ensure the durability of the fuel processor and stack catalysts. This paper investigates four plant layouts with different anode off-gas recirculation schemes and biogas reforming methods: (1) pre-reforming with hot recirculation (HR), (2) pre-reforming with cold recirculation (CR), (3) no pre-reforming and hot recirculation (NR), (4) partial oxidation with hot recirculation (PO). All the schemes feature an electrolyte supported SOFC working at 860&deg;C and 0.23 A\/cm2 current density. A sensitivity analysis of the plant efficiency as a function of the Recirculation Ratio (RR) and the Reformer Temperature (RT) is performed. The results show that HR and CR schemes achieve the highest efficiency (58-63%). The HR scheme benefits from the recirculated water and does not require external water for RR &gt; 50% and RT &gt; 600&deg;C; the CR scheme achieves the same result for RR &gt; 80% and RT &gt; 700&deg;C.

To ensure the system safety and catalysts durability, additional mineral-bearing water and carbon deposition should be avoided. This paper conducted a detailed biogas-SOFC CHP system analysis considering four layouts, featuring hot and cold recirculation of the anode off-gas, partial oxidation and complete internal reforming. The process optimization and sensitivity analysis are performed with the design variables including the recirculation ratio, and external reformer temperature. The anode supported SOFC operates at 800 &deg;C and 0.4 A\/cm2 current density. The results show that pre-reforming with hot recirculation and cold recirculation schemes achieve the highest system efficiency between 56% and 63%. The pre-reforming with hot recirculation scheme has a broader self-sufficient water range eliminating the carbon deposition risk at the recirculation ratio of 42&ndash;78% and reforming temperature of 400&ndash;650 &deg;C. The no pre-reforming with hot recirculation scheme achieves maximum system efficiency of 58% due to the fuel dilution. Moreover, the partial oxidation with hot recirculation scheme maximum efficiency is limited to 58.9%, given that the partial oxidation reaction is less efficient than steam and dry reforming reactions. The proposed system layout could demonstrate the feasibility of biogas-SOFC with different reforming options especially on small scale with high efficiency and optimal thermal integration opportunities.<\/p>","keywords":["Biogas reforming","Solid oxide fuel cell","Dry reforming","Partial oxidation","Carbon deposition","Off-gas recirculation"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-09-27T11:57:12.509Z","updated":"2022-09-28T06:45:52.527Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":20.0,"version_unique_downloads":13.0,"version_views":24.0,"version_unique_views":15.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","name":"Ma, Shuai"},{"affiliation":"Department of Economics, Engineering, Society and Business Administration, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy","name":"Gabriele, Loreti"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Energy Power Innovation, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","name":"Wang, Ligang","orcid":"0000-0002-1666-3541"},{"affiliation":"Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Sion, Switzerland","name":"Mar\u00e9chal, Fran\u00e7ois"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Sion, Switzerland","name":"Van herle, Jan"},{"affiliation":"State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China","name":"Dong, Changqing"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2022},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.6610791","title":"Dataset for manuscript \"Laboratory investigation of hydraulic fracture growth in Zimbabwe gabbro\"","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/6610791","description":"<p>Dataset for manuscript: &quot;Laboratory investigation of hydraulic fracture growth in Zimbabwe gabbro&quot; -- dataset of GABB-003, GABB-005 and GABB-006&nbsp;experiments<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-09-23T12:50:58.509Z","updated":"2022-09-23T14:26:23.328Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":0.0,"version_unique_downloads":0.0,"version_views":26.0,"version_unique_views":22.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"ENAC-IIC-GEL-EPFL","name":"Liu,Dong","orcid":"0000-0001-9236-1708"},{"affiliation":"ENAC-IIC-GEL-EPFL","name":"Lecampion,Brice","orcid":"0000-0001-9201-6592"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.6610790","year":2022},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.7077502","title":"Data set for the manuscript 'Polarization-controlled chromo-encryption'","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/7077502","description":"<p>In this dataset, there are&nbsp;1 pdf and 2&nbsp;zip files.<\/p>\n\n<p>The manuscript (<strong><em>Zenodo OpenData for chromo encryption<em>.<\/em>pdf<\/em><\/strong>) contains the figures of simulated and measured spectra.<\/p>\n\n<p>The corresponding raw data can refer to the 2 zip files (<strong><em>Simulated.zip <\/em><\/strong>and<strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>Measured<em>.<\/em>pdf<\/em><\/strong>).<\/p>","keywords":["polarization","chromo-encryption","structural colors"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-09-14T06:36:45.497Z","updated":"2022-09-14T14:26:27.391Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":12.0,"version_unique_downloads":7.0,"version_views":22.0,"version_unique_views":18.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Hsiang-Chu Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-0738-5586"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Olivier J.F.

To meet the demand of new more complex applications and ensuring adequate battery lifetime, wearable sensors have evolved into multi-core systems with advanced power-saving capabilities and additional heterogeneous components. In this paper, we present an approach that applies optimization and parallelization techniques uncovered by modern ultra-low power platforms in the SW layers with the goal of improving the mapping and reducing the energy consumption of biomedical applications. Additionally, we investigate the benefit of integrating domain-specific accelerators to further reduce the energy consumption of the most computationally expensive kernels. Using 30-second excerpts of signals from two public databases, we apply the proposed optimization techniques on well-known modules of biomedical benchmarks from the state-of-the-art and two complete applications. We observe speed-ups of 5.17x and energy savings of 41.6% for the multi-core implementation using a cluster of 8 cores with respect to single-core wearable sensor designs when processing a standard 12-lead ECG signal analysis. Additionally, we conclude that the minimum workload required to take advantage of parallelization for a hearbeat classifier corresponds to the processing of 3-lead ECG signals, with a speed-up of 2.96x and energy savings of 19.3%. Moreover, we observe additional energy savings of up to 7.75% and 16.8% by applying power management and memory scaling to the multi-core implementation of the 3-lead beat classifier and 12-lead ECG analysis, respectively. Finally, by integrating hardware (HW) acceleration we observe overall energy savings of up to 51.3% for the 12-lead ECG analysis.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-05-27T08:29:21.331Z","updated":"2022-07-26T17:53:53.152Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":24.0,"version_unique_downloads":22.0,"version_views":27.0,"version_unique_views":25.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","name":"Elisabetta de Giovanni","orcid":"0000-0003-3032-5140"},{"affiliation":"University of Bologna","name":"Fabio Montagna","orcid":"0000-0002-0445-6430"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","name":"Benoit Denkinger","orcid":"0000-0002-1959-2013"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","name":"Simone Machetti","orcid":"0000-0002-2887-5031"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","name":"Miguel Pe\u00f3n-Quir\u00f3s","orcid":"0000-0002-5760-090X"},{"affiliation":"University of Bologna","name":"Simone Benatti","orcid":"0000-0002-5700-5342"},{"affiliation":"University of Bologna","name":"Davide Rossi","orcid":"0000-0002-0651-5393"},{"affiliation":"University of Bologna","name":"Luca Benini","orcid":"0000-0001-8068-3806"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne","name":"David Atienza","orcid":"0000-0001-9536-4947"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2020},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.6574838","title":"CNS nuclei distance","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/6574838","description":"<p>Matlab Code to compare cell nuclei distances in 3D volume (e.g. Central Nervous System). &nbsp;Related to Jiao et al. 2022 -&nbsp;doi:&nbsp;https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/2021.11.03.467146<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2022-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-05-23T20:25:33.127Z","updated":"2022-05-24T01:50:38.691Z","resource_type":"Software","version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_views":33.0,"version_unique_views":32.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Jiao, Wei"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Shi, Ying"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"McCabe, Brian D.","orcid":"0000-0003-1620-0501"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.6574837","year":2022},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.6564426","title":"Data for: Wind-induced hypolimnetic upwelling between the multi-depth basins of Lake Geneva during winter: An overlooked deepwater renewal mechanism?","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/6564426","description":"<p>Combining field observations, 3D hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking, we investigated wind-driven interbasin exchange, and in particular hypolimnetic upwelling, between the deep <em>Grand Lac<\/em> (max. depth 309 m) and shallow <em>Petit Lac<\/em> (max. depth 75 m) basins of Lake Geneva (Switzerland\/France) during the weakly stratified fall\/winter period 2018-2019.<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe data include measurements from moored Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and vertical thermistor lines along with the corresponding 3D modeling and particle tracking results.<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe three-dimensional model used in this study is based on the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm, http:\/\/mitgcm.org\/, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1029\/96JC02775).<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\nThe particle tracking code is based on ctracker (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.1034118)<\/p>","keywords":["Lake Geneva","physical limnology","interbasin exchange","upwelling","numerical modeling","particle tracking"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2022-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2022-05-20T05:52:15.927Z","updated":"2022-05-20T13:50:04.967Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":1.0,"version_views":41.0,"version_unique_views":34.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Reiss, Rafael S.","orcid":"0000-0002-5000-6799"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Lemmin, U."},{"name":"Barry, D.

For this purpose, it reviews the data available on quasi-static cyclic tests on masonry walls in the recently assembled European database for URM walls. Based on this review, it proposes two simple drift capacity models. Both models account for the unit typology. In addition, Model 1 accounts for the failure mode and follows therefore the traditional form for URM drift capacity models. Unlike the current drift capacity model in the current EC8-Part 3 [2], it introduces an axial load ratio limit of 0.3. Walls subjected to higher ALR should be avoided; if this is not possible, it should be assumed that they have only one third of the drift capacity of walls with ALR &le; 0.3. Note that the idea of an ALR-limit is already included in the German national annex to Eurocode 8 [38] for walls failing in shear. It limits the SD drift capacity of 0.4%, which is specified in the current EC8-Part 3, to walls with an ALR &le; 0.15. For walls with a larger ALR, the drift capacity is reduced to 0.3%.<\/p>\n\n<p>All files, from the extraction of the data from the data bases to the files for plotting the figures are publicly shared.

Inspired by nature, we introduce a competitive ligand-mediated approach to selectively and interchangeably reinforce metal-coordinated hydrogels. This is achieved by reinforcing carboxylate-containing hydrogels with Fe<sup>3+<\/sup>&nbsp;ions. Key to achieving a homogeneous, predictable reinforcement of the hydrogels is the presence of weak complexation agents that delay the formation of metal-complexes within the hydrogels, thereby allowing a homogeneous distribution of the metal ions. The resulting metal-reinforced hydrogels show a compressive modulus of up to 2.5 MPa, while being able to withstand pressures as high as 0.6 MPa without appreciable damage. Competitive ligand exchanges offer an additional advantage: they enable non-linear compositional changes that, for example, allow the formation of joints within these hydrogels. These features open up new possibilities to extend the field of use of metal reinforced hydrogels to load-bearing applications that are omnipresent for example in soft robots and actuators.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-10-01T11:51:09.535Z","updated":"2023-02-02T13:40:32.826Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":2.0,"version_unique_downloads":2.0,"version_views":63.0,"version_unique_views":55.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Hirsch, Matteo","orcid":"0000-0002-5030-9538"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Steinacher, Mathias"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Zhao, Ran"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Amstad, Esther"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2021},{"doi":"10.1002\/adfm.202005929","title":"3D Printing of Strong and Tough Double Network Granular Hydrogels","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/5543322","description":"<p>Many soft natural tissues display a fascinating set of mechanical properties that remains unmatched by manmade counterparts. These unprecedented mechanical properties are achieved through an intricate interplay between the structure and locally varying the composition of these natural tissues. This level of control cannot be achieved in soft synthetic materials. To address this shortcoming, a novel 3D printing approach to fabricate strong and tough soft materials is introduced, namely double network granular hydrogels (DNGHs) made from compartmentalized reagents. This is achieved with an ink composed of microgels that are swollen in a monomer-containing solution; after the ink is additive manufactured, these monomers are converted into a percolating network, resulting in a DNGH. These DNGHs are sufficiently stiff to repetitively support tensile loads up to 1.3&nbsp;MPa. Moreover, they are more than an order of magnitude tougher than each of the pure polymeric networks they are made from. It is demonstrated that this ink enables printing macroscopic, strong, and tough objects, which can optionally be rendered responsive, with high shape fidelity. The modular and robust fabrication of DNGHs opens up new possibilities to design adaptive, strong, and tough hydrogels that have the potential to advance, for example, soft robotic applications.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-10-01T11:45:40.816Z","updated":"2021-10-04T04:02:01.770Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":4.0,"version_unique_downloads":4.0,"version_views":44.0,"version_unique_views":41.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Hirsch, Matteo","orcid":"0000-0002-5030-9538"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Charlet, Alvaro"},{"name":"Amstad, Esther"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2020},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.5525773","title":"Hydraulic fracturing block test experiments in Gabbro & Marble - experiments # GABB-002 & MARB-007","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/5525773","description":"<p>This dataset contains raw, processed and inverted data for 2 hydraulic fracturing tests performed in a Zimbabwe gabbro (GABB-002) and a Carrara Marble (MARB-007) at the Geo-Energy lab @ EPFL.<\/p>\n\n<p>[IMPORTANT NOTE: DUE TO file size-constraint, the raw binary filed containing the acoustic data is not part of this zenodo data set - Please contact Prof. B.

It is characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. About 1 out of 3 patients have drug-resistant epilepsy, thus their seizures cannot be controlled by medication. Automatic detection of epileptic seizures can substantially improve the patient&#39;s quality of life. To achieve a high-quality model, we have to collect data from various patients in a central server. However, sending the patient&#39;s raw data to this central server puts patient privacy at risk and consumes a significant amount of energy. To address these challenges, in this work, we have designed and evaluated a standard federated learning framework in the context of epileptic seizure detection using a deep learning-based approach, which operates across a cluster of machines. We evaluated the accuracy and performance of our proposed approach on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit based on the EPILEPSIAE database, which is one of the largest public epilepsy datasets for seizure detection. Our proposed framework achieved a sensitivity of 81.25%, a specificity of 82.00%, and a geometric mean of 81.62%. It can be implemented on embedded platforms that complete the entire training process in 1.86 hours using 344.34 mAh energy on a single battery charge. We also studied a personalized variant of the federated learning, where each machine is responsible for training a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the discriminative electrocardiography (ECG) features of the epileptic seizures of the specific person monitored based on its local data. In this context, the DNN benefitted from a well-trained model without sharing the patient&#39;s raw data with a server or a central cloud repository. We observe in our results that personalized federated learning provides an increase in all the performance metric, with a sensitivity of 90.24%, a specificity of 91.58%, and a geometric mean of 90.90%.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-07-23T07:59:36.521Z","updated":"2021-08-03T12:22:56.730Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":85.0,"version_unique_downloads":85.0,"version_views":43.0,"version_unique_views":42.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Baghersalimi, Saleh"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Teijeiro, Tomas","orcid":"0000-0002-2175-7382"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Atienza, David","orcid":"0000-0001-9536-4947"},{"affiliation":"Lund University","name":"Aminifar, Amir","orcid":"0000-0002-1673-4733"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2021},{"doi":"10.1038\/s41597-021-00937-4","title":"The COUGHVID crowdsourcing dataset, a corpus for the study of large-scale cough analysis algorithms","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/5126606","description":"<p>Cough audio signal classification has been successfully used to diagnose a variety of respiratory conditions, and there has been significant interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to provide widespread COVID-19 screening.

A critical aspect in exploring new semiconducting materials and demonstrating their enhanced functionality consists in disentangling them from the artifacts of defects. Nanowires are diameter-tailored filamentary structures that tend to be defect-free and thus ideal model systems for a given material. Here, an additional advantage is demostrated, which is the determination of the band structure, by performing high energy and spatial resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy in aloof and inner beam geometry in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The experimental results are complemented by spectroscopic ellipsometry and are excellently correlated with first principles calculations.

The confined eigenmodes of a chiral magnet are hence no longer the conventional standing spin waves.

In micromagnetic simulations we find similarly rich spectra. They indicate the simultaneous excitation of both dipole- and exchange-dominated spin waves with wavelengths down to (47.2 &plusmn; 0.05) nm attributed to the exchange interaction modulation. Our results suggest the DMI to be effective in creating exchange spin waves in a bulk sample without the challenging nanofabrication and thereby in exploring their scattering with noncollinear spin textures.<\/p>","keywords":["Spin waves","Chiral magnet","Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-07-02T19:47:37.307Z","updated":"2021-07-03T05:16:50.016Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":37.0,"version_unique_downloads":22.0,"version_views":76.0,"version_unique_views":74.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Che, Ping","orcid":"0000-0003-3317-8705"},{"affiliation":"Physik Department E10, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, 85748 Garching, Germany","name":"Stasinopoulos, Ioannis","orcid":"0000-0003-4645-4254"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Mucchietto, Andrea","orcid":"0000-0001-5562-3916"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Li, Jianing"},{"affiliation":"Institut de Physique de la Mati\u00e8re Complexe, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Berger, Helmuth"},{"affiliation":"Physik Department E51, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, 85748 Garching, Germany; Zentrum f\u00fcr QuantumEngineering (ZQE), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, D-85748 Garching, Germany","name":"Bauer, Andreas","orcid":"0000-0002-1070-9748"},{"affiliation":"Physik Department E51, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, 85748 Garching, Germany; Zentrum f\u00fcr QuantumEngineering (ZQE), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Munich Center for Quantum Science and Technology (MCQST), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, D-85748 Garching, Germany","name":"Pfleiderer, Christian"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Grundler, Dirk"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.5062921","year":2021},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.5055755","title":"Obtaining Better Static Word Embeddings Using Contextual Embedding Models","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/5055755","description":"<p><strong>Obtaining Better Static Word Embeddings Using Contextual Embedding Models<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This repository contains the dataset of pretrained word embeddings as well as datasets used to train them, released with the following <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2106.04302.pdf\">paper<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Obtaining Better Static Word Embeddings Using Contextual Embedding Models&rdquo; <em>ACL<\/em> (2021).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>The wikipedia datasets were preprocessed from the wikipedia dump downloaded from <a href=\"http:\/\/dumps.wikimedia.org\">dumps.wikimedia.org<\/a> under&nbsp;Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike 3.0 License .<\/p>\n\n<p>If you found the provided resources useful, please cite the above paper.

The teaching team and the research data management (RDM) support team are part of it and belong to the same unit. It is obvious for team coordinators and the head of unit that there are high synergies between teaching librarians and RDM-specialists. Each of them have complementary skills that are essential for developing and improving services, including in the area of data literacy. But do teams have the same perceptions about these skills and synergies? Where do they place those skills in their professional landscape?<\/p>\n\n<p>To have a better understanding of their specific perceptions, we decided to create a grid to assess the two teams&rsquo; perceptions and skills. We used reference frameworks describing skills in the respective literacies.<\/p>\n\n<p>The grid aims to support library management in knowing how these sets of skills are perceived by their team: are they within the scope of the library? And are these skills present within the competencies of the library staff?

We have approached this issue in the context of online detection of epileptic seizures by developing a DL model from EEG signals, and associating certain properties of the model behavior with the expert medical knowledge. This has conditioned the preparation of the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the output in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the discussion on three main aspects: (1) how to aggregate the classification results on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale, at the seizure-level; (2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in the first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual interpretation of EEG is based; and (3) the identification of the signal waveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the activation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method. Results show that the kernel size in the first layer determines the interpretability of the extracted features and the sensitivity of the trained models, even though the final performance is very similar after post-processing. Also, we found that amplitude is the main feature leading to an ictal prediction, suggesting that a larger patient population would be required to learn more complex frequency patterns. Still, our methodology was successfully able to generalize patient inter-variability for the majority of the studied population with a classification F1-score of 0.873 and detecting 90% of the seizures.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-05-31T10:48:22.684Z","updated":"2021-05-31T20:40:20.078Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":34.0,"version_unique_downloads":33.0,"version_views":40.0,"version_unique_views":39.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Gabeff, Valentin"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Teijeiro, Tomas","orcid":"0000-0002-2175-7382"},{"affiliation":"HEIG-VD\/HES-SO","name":"Zapater, Marina","orcid":"0000-0002-6971-1965"},{"affiliation":"CHUV","name":"Cammoun, Leila"},{"affiliation":"Hospices Civils de Lyon","name":"Rheims, Sylvain","orcid":"0000-0002-4663-8515"},{"affiliation":"CHUV","name":"Ryvlin, Philippe","orcid":"0000-0001-7775-6576"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Atienza, David","orcid":"0000-0001-9536-4947"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2021},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4792205","title":"Experimental investigation into turbulent free-surface flows over a steep permeable bed","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4792205","description":"<p>Data set (Experimental conditions profiles) and python scripts to generate figures for the paper entitled &quot;Experimental investigation into turbulent free-surface flows over a steep permeable bed&quot;&nbsp;by Rousseau G. and Ancey C<\/p>","keywords":["Turbulent boundary layers, low relative submergence, steep streams, per- meable porous beds, dispersive stress"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-05-25T15:12:29.960Z","updated":"2021-05-29T15:09:01.267Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":10.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_views":28.0,"version_unique_views":24.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"ROUSSEAU Gauthier","orcid":"0000-0001-9562-9255"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"ANCEY Christophe"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4792204","year":2021},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4772819","title":"Dataset- Early invasion of the bladder wall by solitary bacteria protects uropathogenic E. coli from antibiotics and neutrophil swarms in an organoid model","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4772819","description":"<p>Dataset comprises raw image stacks and summary of processed figures for the manuscript.

It includes beat-to-beat annotations of the ICG characteristic points, made by a cardiologist, with the purpose of testing ICG delineation algorithms. A reference of synchronous ECG signals is included to allow comparison and mark cardiac events.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Raw data<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The database includes 48 recordings of ICG and ECG signals from 24 healthy subjects during an experimental session of a virtual search and rescue mission with drones, described in [1]. Two segments of 5-minute signals are selected from each subject; one corresponding to baseline state (task BL) and the second one is recorded during higher levels of cognitive workload (task CW). In total, the presented database consisted of 240 minutes of ICG signals.<\/p>\n\n<p>During the experiment, various signals were recorded, but here only ICG and ECG data are provided. Raw data was recorded with 2000Hz using the Biopac system.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Preprocessing (filtering)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Further, for the purpose of annotation by cardiologists, data were first downsampled to 250Hz instead of 2000Hz. Further, it was filtered with an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter of order 3. &ldquo;Adaptive&#39;&#39; refers to the adaptive selection of filter length, which plays a major role in the efficacy of the filter. The filter length was selected based on the first 3 seconds of each signal recording SNR level, following the procedure described below.<\/p>\n\n<p>Starting from a filter length of 3 (i.e., the minimum length allowed), the length is increased in steps of two until signal SNR reaches 30 or the improvements are lower than 1% (i.e., the saturation of SNR improvement with further filter length increase). These values present a good compromise between reducing noise and over-smoothing of the signal (and hence potentially losing valuable details) and a lower filter length, thus reducing complexity. The SNR is calculated as a ratio between the 2-norm of the high and low signal frequencies considering 20Hz as cut-off frequency.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Annotation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>In order to assess the performance of the ICG delineation algorithms, a subset of the database was annotated by a cardiologist from Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) in Switzerland.<\/p>\n\n<p>The annotated subset consists of 4 randomly chosen signal segments containing 10 beats from each subject and task (i.e., 4 segments from BL and 4 from CW task). Segments of signals with artifacts and very noisy were excluded when selecting the data for annotation, and in this case, 8 segments were chosen from the task with cleaner signals. In total, 1920 (80x24) beats were selected for annotation.<\/p>\n\n<p>For each cardiac cycle, four characteristic points were annotated: B, C, X and O. The following definitions were used when annotating the data:<\/p>\n\n<p>- C peak -- Defined as the peak with the greatest amplitude in one cardiac cycle that represents the maximum systolic flow.<\/p>\n\n<p>- B point -- Indicates the onset of the final rapid upstroke toward the C point [3] that is expressed as the point of significant change in the slope of the ICG signal preceding the C point. It is related to the aortic valve opening. However, its identification can be difficult due to variations in the ICG signals morphology. A decisional algorithm has been proposed to guide accurate and reproducible B point identification [4].<\/p>\n\n<p>- X point -- Often defined as the minimum dZ\/dt value in one cardiac cycle. However, this does not always hold true due to variations in the dZ\/dt waveform morphology [5]. Thus, the X point is defined as the onset of the steep rise in ICG towards the O point. It represents the aortic valve closing which occurs simultaneously as the T wave end on the ECG signal.<\/p>\n\n<p>- O point -- The highest local maxima in the first half of the C-C interval. It represents the mitral valve opening.<\/p>\n\n<p>Annotation was performed using open-access software (<a href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.4724843\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5281\/zenodo.4724843<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Annotated points are saved in separate files for each person and task, representing the location of points in the original signal.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Data structure<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Data is organized in three folders, one for raw data (01_RawData), filtered data (02_FilteredData), and annotated points (03_ExpertAnnotations). In each folder, data is separated into files representing each subject and task (except in 03_ExpertAnnotations where 2 CW task files were not annotated due to an excessive amount of noise).<\/p>\n\n<p>All files are Matlab .mat files.<\/p>\n\n<p>Raw data and filtered data .mat files contain &bdquo;ICG&ldquo;, &bdquo;ECG&ldquo; synchronized data, as well as &ldquo;samplFreq&ldquo;values. In filtered data final chosen Savitzky-Golay filter length (&ldquo;SGFiltLen&rdquo;) is provided too.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Annotated data .mat file contains only matrix &bdquo;annotPoints&ldquo; with each row representing one cardiac cycle, while in columns are positions of B, C, X and O points, respectively. Positions are expressed as a number of samples from the beginning of full database files (signals from 01_RawData and 02_FilteredData folders). In rare cases, there are less than 40 (or 80) values per file, when data was noisy and cardiologists couldn&#39;t annotate confidently each cardiac cycle.<\/p>\n\n<p>-------------------<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>[1] F.

We present an approach to produce strain-free epitaxial thin films of Co10&ndash;xZn10&ndash;yMnx+y using molecular beam epitaxy. Bulk Co10&ndash;xZn10&ndash;yMnx+y is known to host skyrmions at room temperature for specific composition ratios. Our substrate consists of graphene on oxidized silicon. The van der Waals interactions of the grown material with graphene avoids covalent bonding and corresponding strain. We show how defects in the graphene foster nucleation resulting into three different kinds of morphologies: islands, columns and merged films. Susceptibility measurements suggest a phase transition close to room temperature. We detect up to three spin waves resonances suggesting relatively low magnetic damping. This growth technique opens a new route for integrating complex alloys and skyrmionic device concepts with silicon electronics.<\/p>","keywords":["thin films, van der Waals epitaxy, molecular beam epitaxy, skyrmions"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-05-01T15:51:58.467Z","updated":"2021-05-03T01:48:14.421Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":121.0,"version_unique_downloads":25.0,"version_views":51.0,"version_unique_views":46.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL , Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Anna K\u00fako\u013eov\u00e1","orcid":"0000-0002-3377-7647"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials,Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Simon Escobar Steinvall"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials,Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Rajrupa Paul"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials,Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Jean-Baptiste Leran"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL , Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Ping Che"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL , Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Mohammad Hamdi"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL , Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Andrea Mucchietto"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials and Institute of Microengineering, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL , Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Dirk Grundler","orcid":"0000-0002-4966-9712"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Semiconductor Materials,Institute of Materials and Institute of Physics, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne EPFL, Lausanne 1015, Switzerland","name":"Anna Fontcuberta i Morral","orcid":"0000-0002-3377-7647"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4711358","year":2021},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4724843","title":"Physiological signals labeler","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4724843","description":"<p>The <em>Labeler Software<\/em> is intended to enhance the annotation process for biological signals data.

We image using phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy propagating spin waves in a one-dimensional magnonic crystal consisting of dipolarly coupled magnetic nanostripes. We demonstrate phase shifts upon a single nanostripe of opposed magnetization. Using micromagnetic simulations, we model our experimental finding in a wide parameter space of bias fields and wave vectors. We find that low-loss phase inversion is achieved, when the internal field of the oppositely magnetized nanostripe is tuned such that the latter supports a resonant standing spin wave mode with an odd quantization number at the given frequency. Our results are key for the realization of phase inverters with optimized signal transmission.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>","keywords":["spin wave, magnonic crystal, phase shifter"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2021-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-04-12T10:07:32.914Z","updated":"2021-04-12T12:27:19.685Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":79.0,"version_unique_downloads":45.0,"version_views":107.0,"version_unique_views":96.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Baumgaertl, Korbinian","orcid":"0000-0002-9410-1931"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics, Institute of Materials (IMX) and Institute of Microengineering (IMT), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Grundler, Dirk","orcid":"0000-0002-4966-9712"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4680408","year":2021},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.4649842","title":"Resources for the article \"Investigating the role of educational robotics in formal mathematics education\"","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4649842","description":"<p>This repository contains the material required to reproduce the study looking to investigate the role of educational robotics in formal mathematics education for 15 year old students in the French speaking region of Switzerland.

This article characterizes the statistical foundations of tonal harmony based on the computational analy- sis of expert annotations in a large corpus. Using resampling methods, this study shows that 1) the rank-frequency distribution of chords resembles a power law, i.e. few chords govern a large proportion of the data; 2) chord transitions are referential and chord predictability is sig- nificantly affected by distinguished chord features; 3) tonal harmony conveys directedness in time; and 4) tonal harmony operates differently at the hierarchical levels of chords and keys. These results serve to characterize tonal harmony on empirical grounds and advance the methodological state-of-the-art in digital musicology.<\/p>","keywords":["music","harmony","tonality","statistical modeling"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2019-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-03-18T16:37:12.170Z","updated":"2021-03-19T06:10:01.737Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":26.0,"version_unique_downloads":26.0,"version_views":19.0,"version_unique_views":19.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Moss, Fabian"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Neuwirth, Markus"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Harasim, Daniel"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Rohrmeier, Martin"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2019},{"doi":"10.5334\/tismir.46","title":"The Tonal Diffusion Model","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4618256","description":"<p><strong>Abstract<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Pitch-class distributions are of central relevance in music information retrieval, computational musicology and various other fields, such as music perception and cognition.

Our model explains the pitch-class distributions of musical pieces by assuming tones to be generated through a latent cognitive process on the Tonnetz, a well-established representation for harmonic relations. Specifically, we assume that all tones in a piece are generated by taking a sequence of interval steps on the Tonnetz starting from a unique tonal origin.

However, experimental studies have primarily focused on the effect of harmony on the cognitive processing of polyphonic music. The additional effect of VL remains unknown, despite music theory suggesting VL to be tightly connected to harmony. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of both VL and harmony on listener expectations. Using a priming paradigm and a choice reaction time task, participants (n = 34) were asked to indicate whether the final chord in a sequence had a different timbre than the preceding ones (cover task), with the experimental conditions being <em>good <\/em>and <em>poor <\/em>VL or harmony, respectively. An analysis with generalised mixed effects models revealed a significant influence of both VL and harmony on reaction times (RTs). Moreover, pairwise comparison showed significantly faster RTs when VL was <em>good <\/em>as compared to both VL and harmony being <em>poor<\/em>, which was not the case when only harmony was <em>good<\/em>. this study thus provides evidence for the additional importance of VL for the processing of Western polyphonic music.<\/p>","keywords":["music, voice-leading, music perception, musical syntax"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-03-18T16:23:14.889Z","updated":"2021-03-19T06:10:07.429Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":25.0,"version_unique_downloads":25.0,"version_views":14.0,"version_unique_views":13.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Wall, Leona"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Lieck, Robert"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Neuwirth, Markus"},{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Rohrmeier, Martin"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2020},{"doi":"10.11116\/MTA.7.1.1","title":"The Syntax of Jazz Harmony: Diatonic Tonality, Phrase Structure, and Form","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4618222","description":"<p><strong>Abstract<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The regularities underlying the structure building of chord sequences, harmonic phrases, and combinations of phrases constitute a central research problem in music theory.

It assumes that chords establish nested hierarchical dependencies that are characterized by two core types: preparation and prolongation. The approach expresses diatonic harmony, embedded modulation, borrowing, and substitution within a single grammatical framework. It is argued in the second part that the proposed framework models not only core phrase structure, but also relations between phrases and the syntactic structures underlying the main forms of Jazz standards. As a special case, the Blues form relies heavily on the plagal derivation from the tonic and is analyzed in comparison with other analytical approaches to the Blues. The proposed theory is specified to a sufficient level of detail that it lends itself to computational implementation and empirical exploration, and this way it makes a step towards music theory building that embraces the close links between formal, mathematical, and computational methods.<\/p>","keywords":["music","jazz","syntax theory","harmony","music theory","generative modeling"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2021-03-18T16:16:04.615Z","updated":"2021-03-19T06:10:11.673Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":94.0,"version_unique_downloads":88.0,"version_views":99.0,"version_unique_views":91.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"EPFL","name":"Rohrmeier, Martin"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2020},{"doi":"10.1080\/17459737.2019.1696899","title":"Axiomatic scale theory","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/4618175","description":"<p><strong>Abstract<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Scales are a fundamental concept of musical practice around the world.

The economic feasibility of grid-balancing plants may be limited by low annual operating hours if they work either only for power generation or only for power storage. This issue might be addressed by a dual-function power plant with power-to-x capability, which can produce electricity or store excess renewable electricity into chemicals at different periods. Such a plant can be uniquely enabled by a solid-oxide cell stack, which can switch between fuel cell and electrolysis with the same stack. This paper investigates the optimal conceptual design of this type of plant, represented by power-to-x-to-power process chains with x being hydrogen, syngas, methane, methanol and ammonia, concerning the efficiency (on a lower heating value) and power densities. The results show that an increase in current density leads to an increased oxygen flow rate and a decreased reactant utilization at the stack level for its thermal management, and an increased power density and a decreased efficiency at the system level. The power-generation efficiency is ranked as methane (65.9%), methanol (60.2%), ammonia (58.2%), hydrogen (58.3%), syngas (53.3%) at 0.4 A\/cm2, due to the benefit of heat-to-chemical-energy conversion by chemical reformulating and the deterioration of electrochemical performance by the dilution of<br>\nhydrogen. The power-storage efficiency is ranked as syngas (80%), hydrogen (74%), methane (72%), methanol (68%), ammonia (66%) at 0.7 A\/cm2, mainly due to the benefit of co-electrolysis and the chemical energy loss occurring in the chemical synthesis reactions. The lost chemical energy improves plant-wise heat integration and compensates for its adverse effect on power-storage efficiency. Combining these efficiency numbers of the two modes results in a rank of round-trip efficiency: methane (47.5%) &gt; syngas (43.3%) &asymp; hydrogen (42.6%) &gt; methanol (40.7%) &gt; ammonia (38.6%).

However, biomass-to-electricity will not be dispatched frequently and becomes less economically- beneficial due to low annual operating hours. This issue can be addressed by integrating biomass-to-electricity and -chemical via &lsquo;&lsquo;reversible&rsquo;&rsquo; solid-oxide cell stacks to form a triple-mode grid-balancing plant, which could flexibly switch among power generation, power storage and power neutral (with chemical production) modes. This paper investigates the optimal designs of such a plant concept with a multi-time heat and mass integration platform considering different technology combinations and multiple objective functions to obtain a variety of design alternatives. The results show that increasing plant efficiencies will increase the total cell area needed for a given biomass feed. The efficiency difference among different technology combinations with the same gasifier type is less than 5% points. The efficiency reaches up to 50%&ndash;60% for power generation mode, 72%&ndash;76% for power storage mode and 47%&ndash;55% for power neutral mode. When penalizing the syngas not converted in the stacks, the optimal plant designs interact with the electrical and gas grids in a limited range. Steam turbine network can recover 0.21&ndash;0.24 kW electricity per kW dry biomass energy (lower heating value), corresponding to an efficiency enhancement of up to 20% points. The difference in the amounts of heat transferred in different modes challenges the design of a common heat exchange network.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2020-10-10T22:58:15.824Z","updated":"2020-10-12T02:40:38.612Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":65.0,"version_unique_downloads":64.0,"version_views":80.0,"version_unique_views":68.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Innovation Research Institute of Energy and Power, North China Electric Power University, China","name":"Wang, Ligang"},{"affiliation":"Innovation Research Institute of Energy and Power, North China Electric Power University, China","name":"Zhang, Yumeng"},{"affiliation":"Innovation Research Institute of Energy and Power, North China Electric Power University, China","name":"Li, Chengzhou"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"P\u00e9rez-Fortes, Mar"},{"affiliation":"Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, Republic of China","name":"Lin, Tzu-En"},{"affiliation":"Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Mar\u00e9chal, Fran\u00e7ois"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Van herle, Jan"},{"affiliation":"Innovation Research Institute of Energy and Power, North China Electric Power University, China","name":"Yang, Yongping"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2020},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3958095","title":"Exposed column base model for OpenSees simulation","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3958095","description":"<p><strong>Exposed column base (XCB) model for OpenSees simulation&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Please read the documentation of the model &#39;<a href=\"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/api\/files\/244a33a0-6e19-49eb-9c1f-48ed3940760c\/XCB_model_documentation.pdf?versionId=d394f38f-428c-4785-9c1d-8f17b346cd7b\">XCB_model_documentation.pdf<\/a>&#39; before using the model.<\/p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/api\/files\/244a33a0-6e19-49eb-9c1f-48ed3940760c\/Generate_XCB.tcl?versionId=4365c9e5-5697-4a2f-910a-1d9d043844b8\">Generate_XCB.tcl<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/api\/files\/244a33a0-6e19-49eb-9c1f-48ed3940760c\/XCB_material.tcl?versionId=85c84151-cfbb-44ae-849c-624c69eb7eb0\">XCB_material.tcl<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>These are the subroutines that generate the XCB model<\/p>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/api\/files\/244a33a0-6e19-49eb-9c1f-48ed3940760c\/Two_Story_DissipativeXCB_MCE_LD_GM1.tcl?versionId=1a2af042-cf6a-4b78-ac21-232665f27f24\">Two_Story_DissipativeXCB_MCE_LD_GM1.tcl<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>This is an example steel moment-resisting frame file in which&nbsp;the subroutines&nbsp;for XCBs are used<\/p>\n\n<p>3. txt files<\/p>\n\n<p>These are some output files (Story drift ratio history and column base moment - rotation responses) obtained from the frame file (<a href=\"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/api\/files\/244a33a0-6e19-49eb-9c1f-48ed3940760c\/Two_Story_DissipativeXCB_MCE_LD_GM1.tcl?versionId=1a2af042-cf6a-4b78-ac21-232665f27f24\">Two_Story_DissipativeXCB_MCE_LD_GM1.tcl<\/a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>4.

When one aims at small footprints, low power consumption, reprogrammable filters, and delay lines, magnons in low-damping ferrimagnets offer great promise. Ferromagnetic grating couplers have been reported to be specifically useful as microwave-to-magnon transducers. However, their interconversion efficiency is unknown and real-space measurements of the emitted magnon wavelengths have not yet been accomplished. Here, we image with subwavelength spatial resolution the magnon emission process into ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) at frequencies up to 8 GHz. We evidence propagating magnons of a wavelength of 98.7 nm underneath the gratings, which enter the YIG without a phase jump.

Magnonics is an evolving branch of magnetism research where information is transported via magnetization oscillations (magnons). Their control and manipulation are so far best accomplished in periodic metamaterials which exhibit properties artificially modulated on the nanoscale. They give rise to functional components, such as band stop filters, magnonic transistors and nanograting couplers. Here, spin\u2010wave excitations in artificial ferromagnetic quasicrystals created via aperiodic arrangement of nanoholes are studied experimentally. Their ten\u2010fold rotational symmetry results in multiplexed magnonic nanochannels, suggesting a width down to 50 nm inside a so\u2010called Conway worm. Key elements of design are emergent magnon motifs and the worm\u2010like features which are scale\u2010invariant and not present in the periodic metamaterials. By imaging wavefronts in quasicrystals, insight is gained into how the discovered features materialize as a dense wavelength division multiplexer.<\/p>","keywords":["magnonics","metamaterials","nanomagnets","quasicrystals","spin waves"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2020-07-17T13:25:41.580Z","updated":"2021-08-07T15:27:37.693Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":34.0,"version_unique_downloads":26.0,"version_views":91.0,"version_unique_views":74.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN), Institute of Materials (IMX), School of Engineering, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Watanabe, Sho"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN), Institute of Materials (IMX), School of Engineering, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Bhat, Vinayak S."},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN), Institute of Materials (IMX), School of Engineering, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Baumgaertl, Korbinian"},{"affiliation":"Laboratory of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN), Institute of Materials (IMX), School of Engineering, \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Grundler, Dirk"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3949941","year":2020},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3942042","title":"Software: Multiple sclerosis cortical and WM lesion segmentation at 3T MRI: A deep learning method based on FLAIR and MP2RAGE","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3942042","description":"<p>This page&nbsp;presents the software and a trained model relative to the paper &quot;Multiple sclerosis cortical and WM lesion segmentation at 3T MRI: a deep learning method based on FLAIR and MP2RAGE.&quot; NeuroImage: Clinical (2020).<\/p>\n\n<p>The software presented on this page is for research purposes only.<\/p>\n\n<p>Given as input the registered FLAIR and MP2RAGE Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans of Multiple Sclerosis patients, the software estimates the lesion segmentation (including both white matter and cortical lesions).

It comprises a theoretical and an experimental part. The theoretical part derives a formalization of long-lived states (LLS) in terms of nuclear spin permutation symmetry. This formalism is suitable in particular with multi-spin systems. A few advantages originate: This formalism derives a convenient representation of LLS as spin population imbalances of nuclear spin states spanning across different irreducible representations. A classification of the symmetry properties of the system&rsquo;s complete Hamiltonian permits to easily find out the number of conserved quantities (under a certain set of introduced approximations). A generalization of the S&oslash;rensen bound in presence of exchange symmetry of the nuclear spin Hamiltonian, initially analysed by Nielsen and S&oslash;rensen and recently investigated by Levitt, is included as it allows to set extra boundary conditions. The experimental part demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of LLS. They are identified and detected either in nearly chemically, magnetic and far from magnetic equivalent systems. The discovery of a more than one hour LLS in a hydrophobic naphthalene&nbsp;derivative molecule is currently fostering the theoretical investigation on field dependent relaxation mechanisms and on practical ways to store and retrieve polarization over an extended time interval. A water soluble version of the molecule has been also investigated and is briefly presented. The naphthalene derivatives experiments are still work in progress. Finally a brief section is dedicated to preliminary hyperpolarization experiments on the hydrophobic naphthalene derivative performed at Ardenkjaer-Larsen&rsquo;s research group in DTU-Copenhagen as a first attempt to store hyperpolarized signal for long time.<\/p>","keywords":["Singlet-states, permutation symmetry, LLS, population imbalance"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2020-03-05T15:37:47.608Z","updated":"2020-03-05T19:20:53.329Z","resource_type":"Thesis","version_downloads":46.0,"version_unique_downloads":46.0,"version_views":37.0,"version_unique_views":36.0,"creators":[{"name":"Gabriele Stevanato","orcid":"0000-0003-0020-1286"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3698065","year":2020},{"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2016.10.009","title":"Alternating Delays Achieve Polarization Transfer (ADAPT) to heteronuclei in PHIP experiments","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3698062","description":"<p>A new methodology for producing hyperpolarized 13C nuclei in small organic systems via parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) is proposed: ADAPT (Alternating Delays Achieve Polarization Transfer).

However, their efficient excitation via microwave fields is still a challenge. Current methods including nanocontacts and grating couplers require advanced nanofabrication tools which limit the broad usage. Here we report efficient emission and detection of exchange magnons using micron-sized coplanar waveguides (CPWs) into which we integrated ferromagnetic(m) layers. We excited magnons in a broad frequency band with wavelengths &lambda; down to 100 nm propagating over macroscopic distances in thin yttrium iron garnet. Applying time- and spatially resolved Brillouin light scattering as well as micromagnetic simulations we evidence a significant wavelength conversion process near mCPWs via tunable inhomogeneous fields. We argue that optimized mCPWs form microwave-to-magnon transducers providing phase-coherent exchange magnons with&nbsp; down to below 40 nm. Without any nanofabrication they allow one to harvest the advantages of nanomagnonics by antenna designs exploited in conventional microwave circuits.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2020-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2020-01-31T16:33:37.979Z","updated":"2020-02-03T06:44:51.000Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":114.0,"version_unique_downloads":75.0,"version_views":217.0,"version_unique_views":193.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"\u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Che Ping"},{"affiliation":"\u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Baumgaertl Korbinian"},{"affiliation":"\u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"K\u00fakol'ov\u00e1 Anna"},{"affiliation":"INNOVENT e.V., Technologieentwicklung, Pr\u00fcssingstr. 27B, 07745 Jena, Germany","name":"Dubs Carsten"},{"affiliation":"\u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Grundler Dirk"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3633074","year":2020},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3614079","title":"Dataset: Seismic Performance of Slender RC U-shaped Walls with a Single-Layer of Reinforcement","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3614079","description":"<p>This dataset contains the experimental data for two large-scale reinforced concrete U-shaped wall specimens tested at the Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Laboratory (EESD Lab), &Eacute;cole Polytechnique F&eacute;derale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.&nbsp; This dataset contains supplementary material for the journal paper titled, &quot;Seismic Performance of Slender RC U-shaped Walls with a Single-Layer of Reinforcement&quot;, which contains some of the experimental observations and results.&nbsp; Thus, this dataset also contains MATLAB files associated with calculating the results presented in the journal paper and the corresponding figures and plots.&nbsp; The abstract for the journal paper is below:<\/p>\n\n<p>Reinforced concrete walls are typically used to resist the lateral loading induced by wind and earthquake actions.

In order to reduce such costs, two onsite storage technologies, i.e., power-to-hydrogen-to-power and lithium battery, are investigated considering 14 uncertain technological and economic parameters. Probability density distributions of wind forecasting errors and power level are first considered to quantify the imbalance and excess wind power. Then, robust optimal sizing of the onsite storage is performed under uncertainty to maximize wind-farm profit (the net present value). Global sensitivity analysis is further carried out for parameters prioritization to highlight the key influential parameters. The results show that the profit of power-to-hydrogen-to-power case is sensitive to the hydrogen price, wind forecasting accuracy and hydrogen storage price. When hydrogen price ranges in (2, 6) &euro;\/kg, installing only electrolyzer can earn profits over 100 k&euro;\/MWWP in 9% scenarios with capacity below 250 kW\/MWWP, under high hydrogen price (over 4 &euro;\/kg); while installing only fuel cell can achieve such high profits only in 1.3% scenarios with capacity below 180 kW\/MWWP.

Electrolysis stack performance and durability determine the system design, performance, and long-term operating strategy; thus, solid-oxide electrolyzer based power-to-fuels were investigated from the stack to system levels. At the stack level, the data from a 6000-h stack testing under laboratory isothermal conditions were used to calibrate a quasi-2D model, which enables to predict practical, isothermal stack performance with reasonable accuracy. Feasible stack operating windows meeting various design specifications (e.g., specific syngas composition) were further generated to support the selection of operating points. At the system level, with the chosen similar stack operating points, various power-to-fuel systems, including power-to-hydrogen, power-to-methane, power-to-methanol (dimethyl ether) and power-to-gasoline, were compared techno-economically considering system-level heat integration.

Bi-objective optimization is performed to understand the trade-off between system efficiency and methane production with the effects of the key design variables. The results indicate that oxygen sweep only marginally affected the system performance (6% reduction in methane production at the same system efficiency). The methanation inside the electrolyzer helped achieve a higher system efficiency (over 90%) by maintaining the electrolyzer temperature as high as possible. Unlike most biogas-upgrading systems, which behaved similarly to the standalone power-to-methane system, with an efficiency range of 70&ndash;86%, the direct biogas-electrolysis performed within a wide efficiency range (52&ndash;88%) and a reduced methane yield (50% less than the other systems operating at 70% efficiency).

The performance of the core component, the electrolyzer, largely determines how well a power-to-methane system can perform, making high-temperature solid-oxide electrolysis attractive because of its inherent high electrical efficiency. More importantly, solid-oxide electrolysis uniquely allows co-electrolysis of steam and CO2for producing syngas, the composition of which can be readily, flexibly adjusted to synthesize different hydrocarbon fuels. In this paper, for both steam- and co-electrolysis, we comprehensively and comparatively investigate several critical design issues of a solid-oxide electrolyzer based power-to-methane system with fixed-bed methanation reactor and membrane-based methane upgrading: (1) system-level heat integration, (2) the impacts of operating variables (e.g., operating voltage, reactant utilization, anode\/cathode feed ratio, and operating pressure of the methanation reactor and membrane) on system performances, (3) the competitiveness of the electrolyzer operation with pure oxygen production, and (4) the possibility of avoiding electrical heating, which is necessary for thermoneutral operation to heat up the electrolyzer feeds to the required temperature. To achieve this target, a multi-objective optimization platform with integrated heat cascade calculation is employed with experimentally-calibrated component models. The results show that, for both steam- and co-electrolysis, there is a trade-off between system efficiency and methane yield: pursuing a higher efficiency generally reduces the methane yield, which is a consequence of electrochemistry, stack cooling, and system-level heat integration. Instead of sweep air, pure oxygen production is preferred only at small current density, which delivers the highest system efficiency but the lowest methane yield. When the electrolyzer operates exothermically, methane production and the total power consumption can vary in much wider ranges than those with the electrolyzer operating under the thermoneutral mode, which leads to potential enhancement of operation flexibility and reliability. The co-electrolysis coupling with strongly-exothermic syngas methanation, in general, offers better heat-integration opportunity with sweep air, but less with pure oxygen production. In addition, several design heuristics, e.g., the operating pressure of the electrolyzer and methanation reactor, are concluded to potentially guide practical applications.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2017-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2019-12-11T18:15:54.819Z","updated":"2020-04-09T10:14:34.324Z","resource_type":"Journal article","version_downloads":138.0,"version_unique_downloads":129.0,"version_views":37.0,"version_unique_views":35.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"Wang, Ligang"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"P\u00e9rez-Fortes, Mar"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"Madi, Hossein"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"Diethelm, Stefan"},{"affiliation":"Group of Energy Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"Van herle, Jan"},{"affiliation":"Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Sion 1951, Switzerland","name":"Mar\u00e9chal, Fran\u00e7ois"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2017},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3568424","title":"Observation of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in Silicon Nitride Integrated Waveguides","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/3568424","description":"<p>1.

The model is composed of an assembly of components, each one accounting for a different source of deformation. Namely: (i) an anchorage-slip element accounting for the strain penetration of the longitudinal reinforcement into the foundation; (ii) a basic tension chord element evaluating the response outside the lap splice zone; and (iii) a lap splice element describing the behaviour within the lap splice region. For an imposed global displacement, the model provides the steel and concrete stress and strain distributions, the crack distribution and opening, as well as the global resisting axial force. For spliced members, the ultimate displacement is computed through a semi-empirical relationship providing the average lap splice strain at failure. Validation is carried out against a series of uniaxial cyclic tests on RC wall boundary elements featuring both continuous and spliced reinforcement; different lap splice lengths and confining reinforcement are considered.<\/p>","keywords":["Tension chord","Lap splices","Mechanical model","Crack width","Boundary element","RC walls"],"license_id":"CC-BY-4.0","publication_date":"2019-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2019-08-28T13:22:12.996Z","updated":"2019-08-28T13:29:14.557Z","resource_type":"Other","version_downloads":304.0,"version_unique_downloads":114.0,"version_views":376.0,"version_unique_views":339.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Laboratory (EESD), School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL).

Here we demonstrate an atypical GaAs vertical nanostructure on Si(100), coined nanospade, obtained by a nonconventional droplet catalyst pinning. The Ga droplet is positioned at the tip of an ultrathin Si pillar with a radial oxide envelope. The pinning at the Si\/oxide interface allows the engineering of the contact angle beyond the Young&ndash;Dupr&eacute; equation and the growth of vertical nanospades. Nanospades exhibit a virtually defect-free bicrystalline nature. Our growth model explains how a pentagonal twinning event at the initial stages of growth provokes the formation of the nanospade. The optical properties of the nanospades are consistent with the high crystal purity, making these structures viable for use in integration of optoelectronics on the Si(100) platform.<\/p>","keywords":null,"license_id":null,"publication_date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2019-05-27T14:56:56.352Z","updated":"2020-01-24T19:22:55.537Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":0.0,"version_unique_downloads":0.0,"version_views":37.0,"version_unique_views":36.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"G\u00fcniat,Lucas","orcid":"0000-0001-7883-4433"},{"affiliation":"Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology","name":"Mart\u00ed-Sanchez,Sara"},{"affiliation":"UPC - Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya","name":"Garcia,Oscar"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Boscardin, M\u00e9gane"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Vindice, David"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Tappy, Nicolas"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Friedl,Martin"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Kim, Wonjong"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Zamani, Mahdi"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Francaviglia,Luca"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Balgarkashi, Akshay"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Leran, Jean-Baptiste"},{"affiliation":"Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology","name":"Arbiol,Jordi"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","name":"Fontcuberta I Morral, Anna"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.3232867","year":2019},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.2669473","title":"Raw data for the article: Synthesis of aminyl biradicals by base-induced Csp3-Csp3 coupling of cationic azo dyes","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/2669473","description":"<p>RAW DATA FOR THE ARTICLE<\/p>\n\n<p>TITLE: Synthesis of aminyl biradicals by base-induced Csp3-Csp3 coupling of cationic azo dyes<\/p>\n\n<p>AUTHORS: Yizhu Liu, Paul Varava, Alberto Fabrizio, Leonard Y.

Products derived from ALS have been successfully used in a range of different domains including ecosystem characterization, habitat modeling, timber volume estimation, forest fire management and territorial planning. Many of these applications are dependent on the estimation of biophysical parameters at the canopy and\/or individual tree scale. These parameters are generally computed with area (stand) or object (tree) centric approaches. In particular, the development of processing chains directly or indirectly involving individual tree crown segmentation, tree species classification and allometric modeling constitute the bulk of scientific activity in the domain. However, the diversity of ALS data characteristics and non-standard error assessment procedures means that the results reported in different studies are often difficult to compare. In order to support standardization and benchmark studies, this article presents a reference ALS dataset, an error assessment framework and provides several example workflows to illustrate its potential use in forest research.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","keywords":["lidar","airborne laser scanning","forest","benchmark"],"license_id":null,"publication_date":"2018-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2018-05-25T11:57:24.191Z","updated":"2020-01-24T19:24:53.305Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":34.0,"version_unique_downloads":8.0,"version_views":231.0,"version_unique_views":198.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Geographic Information Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Matthew Parkan"},{"affiliation":"Centre de comp\u00e9tence en sylviculture (CCS), CH-3250 Lyss, Switzerland","name":"Pascal Junod"},{"affiliation":"Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Ren\u00e9 Lugrin"},{"affiliation":"Landscape Dynamics and Remote Sensing Unit, Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland","name":"Christian Ginzler"}],"conceptdoi":"10.5281\/zenodo.1235374","year":2018},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.1205887","title":"Uniaxial Cyclic Tests on Reinforced Concrete Members with Lap Splices","html":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/record\/1205887","description":"<p>This data paper presents the quasi-static uniaxial cyclic tests of 24 RC members, of which 22 feature lap splices and two are reference units with continuous reinforcement.

Such walls have typically only a single layer of vertical rebars and are therefore particularly susceptible to out-of-plane failure. To investigate the response of the corresponding wall boundary elements, twelve reinforced concrete columns with a single layer of vertical rebars were tested under tension-compression cycles. The objective of this test series was to gain insights into parameters triggering wall instability and out-of-plane failure. The experimental tests investigate the effect of thickness, reinforcement ratio, and eccentricity of the longitudinal rebars with respect to the element axis. This paper summarises the results of the test campaign. The specimen response is analysed at the global and local level, and the influence of the crack pattern on the out-of-plane response of the column and the conditions leading to out-of-plane failure are described. Furthermore, the differences between members with a single layer of vertical rebars to members with two layers are discussed.

It is in line with recent attempts to automatise the extraction of literary social networks (Elson, 2012; Sack, 2013) and other studies stressing the importance of character- systems (Woloch, 2003; Moretti, 2011).<br>\nThe method we use to build the network is direct and simple. First, we extract co-occurrences from a book index, without the need for text analysis. We then describe the narrative roles of the characters, which we deduce from their respective positions in the network, i.e. the discourse.<br>\nAs a case study, we use the autobiographical novel Les Confessions by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. We start by identifying co-occurrences of characters in the book index of our edition (Slatkine, 2012). Subsequently, we compute four types of centrality: degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector. We then use these measures to propose a typology of narrative roles for the characters.<br>\nWe show that the two parts of Les Confessions, written years apart, are structured around mirroring central figures that bear similar centrality scores. The first part revolves around the mentor of Rousseau; a figure of openness. The second part centres on a group of schemers, depicting a period of deep paranoia. We also highlight characters with intermediary roles: they provide narrative links between the societies in the life of the author.<br>\nThe method we detail in this complete case study of character network analysis can be applied to any work documented by an index.<\/p>","keywords":["digital literary studies","character network analysis","digital humanities","centrality","network analysis","quantitative literary studies","distant reading"],"license_id":"CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0","publication_date":"2014-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2017-01-24T12:39:40.609Z","updated":"2020-01-20T17:44:08.855Z","resource_type":"Thesis","version_downloads":254.0,"version_unique_downloads":243.0,"version_views":29.0,"version_unique_views":28.0,"creators":[{"name":"Rochat, Yannick"}],"conceptdoi":null,"year":2014},{"doi":"10.5281\/zenodo.15798","title":"A Bayesian Approach to Detect Pedestrian Destination-Sequences from WiFi Signatures: Data (Transp.

Despite this popularity, experimental results on the seismic behavior of U-shaped walls are scarce. For this reason a research program with the objective to provide additional experimental evidence for such walls under seismic loading was developed. It included quasi-static cyclic testing of two U-shaped walls at the structural engineering laboratories of the ETH Zurich. The walls were built at half-scale and designed for high ductility. The main difference between the two walls was their wall thickness. The project was chiefly focusing on the bending behavior in different directions and therefore the walls were subjected to a bi-directional loading regime. This article discusses the design of the test units, the test setup and the test predictions.

The shake-table test, performed at the TREES laboratory of EUCENTRE (Pavia, Italy), was part of a larger research initiative at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) that addresses the seismic behaviour of mixed RC-URM structures. The half-scale test unit was subjected to several shakings of different intensity levels. The paper presents the geometry of the test unit, the properties of the construction materials, the instrumentation, and outlines the organization of the recorded data. Two sets of data are available: the unprocessed data and a second set of processed data where conventional and optical measurements are synchronised. This second set contains also some derived data, which allows to quickly plot key quantities such as base shear and top displacement. The aim of the paper is to provide all information required by the reader for analysing the test data and using it for validation purposes of numerical and mechanical models. The performance of the test unit is described in a companion paper.<\/p>","keywords":["Shake-table test","Unreinforced masonry wall","Reinforced concrete wall","Mixed structure"],"license_id":"CC-BY-SA-4.0","publication_date":"2014-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","created":"2015-07-22T14:44:08.000Z","updated":"2020-01-24T19:25:19.090Z","resource_type":"Dataset","version_downloads":552.0,"version_unique_downloads":144.0,"version_views":536.0,"version_unique_views":496.0,"creators":[{"affiliation":"Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Laboratory (EESD), School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.","name":"Tondelli, Marco"},{"affiliation":"Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics Laboratory (EESD), School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering (ENAC), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.","name":"Petry, Sarah"},{"affiliation":"European Centre for Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering (EUCENTRE), Pavia, Italy.

Though these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons compute noiselessly, in contrast to highly variable neurons in hippocampus and olfactory cortex. Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as internal noise is less than a specified threshold, error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show internal noise actually improves performance of the recall phase. Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis.
